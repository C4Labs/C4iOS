///This document describes the Movie class. You use a Movie object to implement the playback of video files, it encapulates an AVQueuePlayer object which handles the loading and control of assets.
///
///The Movie class is meant to simplify the addition of videos to your application. It is also a subclass of View, and so has all the common animation, interaction and notification capabilities.
///
///A C4Movie’s resizing behaviour is to map itself to the edges of its visible frame. This functionality implicitly uses AVLayerVideoGravityResize as its layer’s default gravity. You can change the frame of the movie from an arbitrary shape back to its original proportion by using its originalSize, originalRatio, or by independently setting either its width or height properties.
